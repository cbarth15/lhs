Launcher starts the program

I have implemented Chinese Checkers with two bonus features:
upon a win the board is cleared and read for the next game  and I added in GUI instructions
to be viewed for new players.

The rules are simple, when the text below the board says who's turn it is(by
gamepiece color) that player will be able to select and move his piece.
Pieces can move in any of the nearby spaces surrounding them, or they can
jump over any pieces surrounding them as many times as they like in the
direction of that piece.
